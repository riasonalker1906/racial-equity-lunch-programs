## Examining the Relationship Between Minority Populations and Free & Reduced-Price School Lunch Enrollment

This study investigates whether enrollment in government-funded Free and Reduced-Price Lunch (FRL) programs in public schools is disproportionately higher in areas with larger minority populations. The analysis explores the relationship between community demographic composition and reliance on subsidized school meal programs.

The project combines data processing, statistical analysis, and visualization to better understand patterns of educational and economic inequality reflected through school lunch program participation.
